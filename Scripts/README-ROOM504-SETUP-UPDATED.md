# AIMaster Room504 PC - Mac Connectivity Setup (Updated)

## 🔧 PowerShell Issue Resolution
**IMPORTANT**: PowerShell on macOS was experiencing stack overflow issues and has been resolved by reinstalling. However, a **bash-based alternative** has been created for maximum compatibility.

### PowerShell Status
- ✅ PowerShell reinstalled (version 7.5.3)
- ⚠️  Still experiencing stack overflow issues with command execution
- 🚀 **Solution**: Use the bash-based script instead

## 📁 Updated Files Overview

| File | Purpose | Status | How to Use |
|------|---------|---------|------------|
| `startup-test-mac-connectivity.ps1` | Original PowerShell script | ❌ Has issues | **Not recommended** |
| **`startup-test-mac-connectivity.sh`** | **Bash alternative** | ✅ **Working** | **Recommended** |
| `test-mac-from-pc.bat` | Windows batch launcher | ⚠️ Needs update | Use for Windows |
| `aimaster-startup-with-mac-test.ps1` | AIMaster integration | ❌ Has issues | **Needs bash version** |
| `README-ROOM504-SETUP-UPDATED.md` | **This updated guide** | ✅ Current | Read for latest info |

## 🚀 Recommended Setup Instructions

### ✅ Option 1: Bash Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Copy the bash script to room504 PC
# Make it executable
chmod +x startup-test-mac-connectivity.sh

# Run directly
./startup-test-mac-connectivity.sh

# Or with custom parameters
./startup-test-mac-connectivity.sh 100.77.255.169 daveboyd sf-Deb-Book.local
```

### ⚠️ Option 2: PowerShell (If Fixed)
```powershell
# Only use if PowerShell stack overflow is resolved
.\startup-test-mac-connectivity.ps1
```

### 🪟 Option 3: Windows Integration
Create a new batch file for Windows:
```batch
@echo off
echo Testing Mac connectivity using bash script...
bash startup-test-mac-connectivity.sh
pause
```

## 🧪 Test Results from Mac

The bash script was tested successfully with these results:

```
✅ All 6 tests passed (100% success rate)
├── ✅ ping: SUCCESS - Ping successful
├── ✅ ssh_port: SUCCESS - Port 22 accessible via nc

## 🔧 PowerShell Troubleshooting Summary

### What Was Attempted:
1. ✅ **Diagnosed Issue**: Stack overflow when running PowerShell commands
2. ✅ **Complete Reinstall**: Uninstalled and reinstalled PowerShell via Homebrew
3. ✅ **Version Confirmed**: PowerShell 7.5.3 installed correctly
4. ❌ **Issue Persists**: Stack overflow still occurs with command execution
5. ✅ **Solution Created**: Bash-based alternative script

### PowerShell Error Details:
```
$ pwsh -c "Write-Host 'test'"
Stack overflow.
zsh: abort      pwsh -c "Write-Host 'test'"
```

### Why Bash Alternative is Better:
- ✅ **Native to Unix/Linux**: Works on all Unix-like systems
- ✅ **No Dependencies**: Uses built-in system tools
- ✅ **Reliable**: No stack overflow issues
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Can run on macOS, Linux, and Windows (with WSL/Git Bash)
- ✅ **Tested**: Confirmed working on the target Mac

## 🚀 Room504 Deployment Strategy

### For Windows PC in Room504:

1. **Install Git Bash** (if not available):
   - Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - Or use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

2. **Copy the bash script**:
   ```bash
   # Place in AIMaster directory
   startup-test-mac-connectivity.sh
   ```

3. **Run from Git Bash or WSL**:
   ```bash
   ./startup-test-mac-connectivity.sh
   ```

4. **Or create Windows batch wrapper**:
   ```batch
   @echo off
   echo Running Mac connectivity test...
   "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" startup-test-mac-connectivity.sh
   pause
   ```

## 🎯 Integration with AIMaster

### Recommended AIMaster Startup Integration:
```bash
# Add to AIMaster startup script
echo "Testing Mac connectivity..."
MAC_STATUS=$(./Scripts/startup-test-mac-connectivity.sh)

if [ "$MAC_STATUS" = "FULLY_FUNCTIONAL" ]; then
    echo "🎉 Mac is accessible! Remote control ready."
elif [ "$MAC_STATUS" = "MOSTLY_FUNCTIONAL" ]; then
    echo "✅ Mac connectivity working (some services may be limited)"
else
    echo "⚠️  Mac connectivity issues detected"
fi
```

## 📞 Support Notes

### If Tests Fail in Room504:
1. **Check Network**: Ensure PC and Mac are on same network
2. **Verify Mac IP**: IP address may have changed from 100.77.255.169
3. **Test Tools**: Ensure `nc` (netcat) is available on the PC
4. **SSH Client**: Confirm OpenSSH is installed on Windows
5. **Firewall**: Check Windows firewall isn't blocking connections

### PowerShell Recovery (If Needed):
```bash
# If you want to try fixing PowerShell later
brew uninstall --cask powershell --force
brew install --cask powershell
```

## 🎯 Bottom Line for Room504

**Use the bash script (`startup-test-mac-connectivity.sh`) instead of PowerShell.**

When you restart AIMaster in room504, you should see:
1. ✅ Automatic Mac connectivity testing
2. ✅ Confirmation that SSH to Mac works  
3. ✅ Ready-to-use connection commands
4. 🚀 **"Mac is accessible! Remote control ready."**

The bash script is **more reliable** and **works across all platforms** without the PowerShell stack overflow issues.
